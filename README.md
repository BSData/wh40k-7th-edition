__Notice__: _However we don't support the 6th Edition, all the files in their last revisions for 6th are available [here](https://github.com/BSData/wh40k/releases/tag/v3.1.4). Downloading .bsr file (green button) and importing it in BattleScribe_ __won't__ _mess with 7th ed files._

##Overview##

* __What's this?__
* _BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles. Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]_

* __Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._
* _Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]_


##Reporting bugs & contact us##

* __I found a bug!__
* _Great, thank you! Now you have two options:_

  1. [Report it on Appspot][] - it's anonymous and no account is needed - on downside, you will need to manually check the progress of your issue.
  2. [Open Issue directly][] (green ```New Issue``` in upper-right)- you need GitHub account and then can track progress (get notifications on it!), comment (ie answer our questions) and help us better!

* __I'd just like to contact you.__
* _Cool, the easiest way is through issues mentioned above. We are a community and that's the only place we all have access to. We don't have any group e-mail. So if you want to stay anonymous, contact us by_ reporting bug _on Appspot (point 1 above)._
