__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles. Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._
